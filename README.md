# AI-Native Developer Portfolio

Personal portfolio website for Erasmo Concepcion, showcasing AI-native development skills and projects.

## Project Purpose
To demonstrate expertise in AI-driven development through a modern, interactive portfolio website featuring a card-stacking scroll effect and AI-themed design elements.

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Structure
-   `index.html`: Main content and structure.
-   `style.css`: Styling and layout (including sticky positioning for stack effect).
-   `js/`: Contains JavaScript logic.
    -   `script.js`: Handles animations, typing effects, and form validation.
-   `assets/`: Directory for images and other media assets.

## AI Usage
This project demonstrates the use of AI tools in development:
-   **AI-Generated**: Initial HTML scaffolding, CSS grid logic for project cards, and typing animation logic.
-   **Manually Written**: Design refinements, specific color palette application, and content curation.
